## :octicons-info-24: What is OpenGamepadUI?

Open Gamepad UI is a free and open source game launcher and overlay written 
using the Godot Game Engine 4 designed with a gamepad native experience in mind. 
Its goal is to provide an open and extendable foundation to launch and play 
games. It also implements a gamepad input system that can allow you to remap 
gamepad input to mouse and keyboard inputs.

## :octicons-light-bulb-24: Features 

- In-game overlay menus
- Power tools (TDP control, SMT, etc.)
- Fully configurable gamepad input (buttons, axes, mouse & keyboard, etc.)
- Per-game customizable gamepad profiles
- Launch games from multiple sources
- Automatic artwork downloading
- Plugin architecture


## :octicons-image-24: How does it work and look?

OpenGamepadUI works hand-in-hand with Gamescope, which is a Wayland compositor
designed for a console-like experience.

Some examples of what it looks like are here:
