# Before you start

OpenGamepadUI is written using the [Godot Game Engine
4](https://godotengine.org/). If you don't have any experience with the
Godot engine, it might be best to try completing a tutorial or two to
get familiar with how the engine, and its scripting language GDScript,
works.

There are some great tutorials here to get started:

- <https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/getting_started/first_2d_game/index.html>
- <https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/community/tutorials.html>
- <https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/index.html>

OpenGamepadUI is primarily written in GDScript and some Rust, but parts
of the project could potentially be written using other languages using
GDExtension, if required.
