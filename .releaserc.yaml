# Semantic Release Configuration
# https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/usage/configuration

# Any merges into branches that match these patterns will trigger a release.
branches:
  - name: main
  #- name: 'v+([0-9])?(.{+([0-9]),x}).x'

# These plugins will run when a release is triggered. They will analyze commit
# messages to determine what kind of release this is and publish a new release.
plugins:
  # Analyze commit messages to determine next version
  - "@semantic-release/commit-analyzer"

  # Generate release notes
  - "@semantic-release/release-notes-generator"

  # Replace version strings in the project. The 'git' plugin is needed to
  # commit the version strings to the repository.
