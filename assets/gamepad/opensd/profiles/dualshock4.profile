[Profile]
# Name
# The profile name as it will appear in the GUI and through the CLI query. 
# Should be unique for each profile to avoid confusion.
#   Value: Any unique name.  Should be enclosed in quotes to preserve spaces.
Name            = "Sony DualShock 4 compatibility profile"

# Description
# The profile description as it will appear in the GUI and through the CLI query. 
#   Value: A brief description.  Should be enclosed in quotes "" to preserve spaces.
Description     = "This profile mimics the appearance and behaviour of the hid_sony driver."


[Features]
# Force Feedback
# Enable haptic feedback / rumble function.
#   Values:  true, false
ForceFeedback   = true

# Motion Device
# If this is set to true, an additional input device will be created which 
# will report motion control data.  Motion axes still need to have thier
# bindings defined.  If this is disabled, any "Motion" bindings will be
# ignored.
#   Values:  true, false
MotionDevice    = true

# Mouse Device
# If this is set to true, an additional input device will be created which
# will be used to send mouse / trackpad events.  Mouse events still need to
# have thier bindings defined.  If this is disabled, any "Mouse" bindings
# will be ignored.
#   Values:  true, false
MouseDevice     = true

# Lizard Mode
# The Steam Controller and the Steam Deck both have a kind of fallback BIOS
# mode which emulates some keyboard and mouse events.  Valve refers to this
# as 'Lizard Mode'.  This mode cannot be redefined.  It sends events 
# IN ADDITION to the gamepad events created by the OpenSD driver, so it 
# should always be disabled. When OpenSD exits, Lizard Mode is re-enabled.
#   Values:  true, false  (recommended: false)
LizardMode      = false

# Stick Filtering
# The thumbsticks on the Steam Deck have a circular range but return square-ish
# data, which makes it feel odd and complicated to apply radial deadzones to.
# Because of this, OpenSD vectorizes the stick position and returns "cleaner",
# round stick ranges, as well as being able to create clean deadzone rescaling.
# If you disable this setting, axis ranges are still internally normalized and 
# rescaled to the the uinput device, but no vectorization will be applied and 
# any deadzones will be ignored.
#   Values:  true, false (recommended: true)
StickFiltering  = true

# Trackpad Filtering
# Similar to above, but matches the square shape of the trackpad.  Filtering is
# only applied to absolute values.  This setting must be enabled to apply 
# deadzones to the trackpad absolute axes.  Relative values (rel_x and rel_y) 
# are unaffected, therefore deadzones do not affect mouse movement with the pads.
#   Values:  true, false (recommended: true)
TrackpadFiltering  = true


[DeviceInfo]
# This section allows you to set the name and USB identity of the individual 
# input devices created by the gamepad driver.  This can be useful to mimic the 
# appearance of a specific controller in order to get a very poorly written game
# to recognise and support it. 
#
# These are optional and will use defaults if undefined.  If the respective
# device is not first enabled in the Feature section, these values will be
# ignored.
#
# Format:
#   <device> = <vid> <pid> <ver> <name string>
#
#   device:  Which device to define.  Can be:  <Gamepad | Motion | Mouse>
#   vid:     Vendor ID.  16-bit hex value starting with "0x"
#   pid:     Product ID.  16-bit hex value starting with "0x"
#   vid:     Version.  16-bit hex value starting with "0x"
#   name:    The name string of the device
# 
# Examples:
#   Gamepad = 0xDEAD 0xBEEF 0x001 "OpenSD Gamepad Device"
#   Motion = 0xDEAD 0xBEEF 0x001 "OpenSD Motion Control Device"
#   Mouse = 0xDEAD 0xF00D 0x001 "OpenSD Mouse Device"

[Deadzones]
# Axis deadzones
# Values are floating point and represent the percentage of the total range to
# ignore.  A value of 0.05 would be a 5% deadzone.  Deadzones are capped at
# 90% (0.9).  A value of 0 is considered disabled.  
# If StickFiltering is disabled, LStick and RStick deadzones will be ignored.  
# If TrackpadFiltering is disabled, LPad and RPad deadzones will be ignored.
#   Supported inputs:  LeftStick, RightStick, LeftPad, RightPad, LeftTrigg, RightTrigg
#   Values: 0.000 to 0.900

[Bindings]
# Gamepad input bindings
#
# This should be a list of all the physical gamepad buttons/sticks/pads/motion
# inputs you want to bind to a virtual input event or command.  Anything not 
# specified here will be considered 'unbound' and not register any event.
#
# Input:
#   Input names reflect the action of the user.  Like pressing a button or 
#   pushing a thumbstick to the left.  Button bindings are pretty self-explanatory.
#   While axes are broken into directional actions (i.e. LeftStickUp). This way
#   you can make an axis send a keypress if you wanted to, and the inverse is 
#   also possible.
#
# BindType:
#   There are two categories of bindings:  Event bindings and Command Bindings.
#
#   Event Bindings:
#     Since OpenSD manages up to 3 separate virtual input devices, you will need
#     to specify which device will send a particular event.  
#     These devices are "Gamepad", "Motion and "Mouse".  
#     
#     Gamepad: This  device is for buttons and axes input.  This device is always
#     enabled.
#
#     Motion: This is a separate input device specifically for motion-sensors
#     like accelerometers and gyroscopes.  This device must be enabled in the
#     [Features] section.
#
#     Mouse: This is a virtual mouse device which uses relative axes (REL) and
#     buttons / keys.  This device must be enabled in the [Features] section.
#
#     Each binding must be mapped to a Linux input event code.  A complete list 
#     can be found in <linux/input-event-codes.h> and the supported codes can be
#     found in the OpenSD documentation.  
#     Most KEY_*, BTN_*, ABS_* and REL_* codes should be usable.
#
#     Event type is derived from the code prefix (i.e. KEY_* is a key event, 
#     ABS_* is an absolute axis event.)
#
#     Axis event bindings MUST specify the direction of the axis.  This allows 
#     buttons to send axis events or allows an axis to be inverted at a driver 
#     level.
#
#     Event binding format:   
#       Input = <Gamepad | Motion | Mouse> <input_event_code> [ + | - ]
#
#     Example:  
#       DPadUp = Gamepad ABS_HAT0Y -
#
#     The above line will bind the up direction on the physical dpad to the negative 
#     (up/left) direction of an absolute axis on the gamepad device.
#
#     There are also some standard meanings for these with regard to device 
#     types and it is possible to configure this section which can cause very
#     strange behaviour.
#
#     Please see the documentation for a more detailed explanation about event
#     bindings.
#
#   Command Bindings:
#     The "Command" binding allows you to execute external programs or scripts
#     by forking them off as a child process.
#
#     Format:  
#       Input = Command <wait_for_exit> <repeat_delay_ms> <command_to_execute>
#
#     wait_for_exit: <true | false> value which specifies if the command should
#     complete before the binding can be triggered again.
#
#     repeat_delay_ms: The amount of time in milliseconds that must elapse before
#     the binding can be triggered again.  The timer starts when the binding is
#     successfully triggered.
#
#     Example:  
#       QuickAccess = Command true 0 rofi -show run
#     
#   Profile Bindings:
#     This binding type allows you to switch to a different profile using just
#     the gamepad input.  Profiles are loaded from the user profile directory.
#
#     Format:
#       Input = Profile <profile_name>
#
#     profile_name: Filename of the profile ini you want to load.  Path is fixed
#     to the user profile directory, so only specify the filename itself.
#
#     Example:
#       L5 = Profile left_hand_mouse.profile
#       
#
#   Valid binding types are:  Gamepad, Mouse, Motion, Command, Profile
#
#
# Input             BindType    Mapping     +/-
